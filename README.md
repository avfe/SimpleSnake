# Java Snake Game
This is the repository of my snake game written in the Java programming language.

# How to play?
1. You need to download the latest Java from [the official website](https://www.java.com/ru/download/) and install it.
2. Now you can download the [game .jar file](https://github.com/avfe/SimpleSnake/blob/master/out/artifacts/SimpleSnake_jar/SimpleSnake.jar) from my repository and run it.

# Feedback
Any feedback for the further development of the project is important to me. I would be glad to see your letters at avfetech@gmail.com.
